PROJECT DIARY
Ignition Protocol: An Evolutionary Engine for Molecular Combustion
Stripe Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition 2026
by Finn Harnedy

================================================================================
1. KICKOFF
================================================================================

[YOUR REFLECTION HERE - June 2025: Why did you start this project? What motivated you?]

Ignition Protocol is a computational framework for discovering, filtering, and operationalizing synthetic fuel candidates. The project emerged from a recognition that synthetic fuels and fuel blends offer a path to reducing reliance on fossil energy while meeting global demand and tightening emissions constraints.

The project combines two complementary systems:
1. A molecular generation module that evolves candidate molecules from fragment libraries using genetic algorithms
2. A deterministic blend optimization engine that selects and proportions components into lab-ready fuel blends

The goal is not just to rank "interesting molecules" but to produce candidate blends that can be mixed, tested, and iterated upon with clear reproducibility.

Key technologies:
- RDKit for molecular validation and manipulation
- GDB-11 database (molecules with up to 11 atoms, optimized for fuel applications)
- Genetic algorithms for molecular evolution
- Deterministic optimization for blend formulation
- Python-based computational framework

The project aims to bridge computational fuel design with practical experimental validation, creating a scalable approach to fuel discovery that respects real-world constraints and produces actionable results.

2. BRAINSTORMING
================================================================================

[YOUR REFLECTION HERE - June-July 2025: What ideas did you explore? What research did you do? How did you decide on this topic?]

June 2025:
The project began with extensive literature review focusing on three key areas:

1. Combustion Fundamentals and Fuel Performance Metrics
   - Research into stoichiometry, ignition chemistry, volatility, and flame propagation
   - Understanding key operational metrics: octane number (RON/MON) for spark-ignition fuels, cetane number for compression-ignition fuels, energy density (LHV), and sooting tendency proxies (PMI/TSI)
   - These metrics would become the foundation for computational scoring and blend constraints

2. Emissions and Regulatory Constraints
   - Study of emissions drivers (NOx, soot/PM, CO, UHC)
   - Infrastructure compatibility requirements
   - Regulatory constraints: volatility limits, sulfur limits, density/flashpoint constraints, seasonal RVP management
   - Recognition that realistic fuel design must treat these as constraints, not afterthoughts

3. AI and Evolutionary Search for Molecular Design
   - Exploration of evolutionary computation in molecular design
   - Genetic algorithms, mutation/crossover operators, multi-objective optimization
   - Modern approaches using surrogate models and ML predictors
   - Decision to use lightweight structural heuristics and fast property proxies initially, with pathway to ML integration

July 2025:
Initial project concepts explored:
- Basic engine prototype focused on molecular generation efficiency
- Fragment-based approach using BRICS (Breaking of Retrosynthetically Interesting Chemical Substructures)
- Heuristic filtering for chemical validity and fuel-relevance
- Surrogate models for fast property estimation

The evolution from basic engine to unified pipeline:
- Initial concept: Simple molecular generation tool
- Realization: Need for operational realism - molecules must work in actual blends
- Future vision: Combine molecular generation with blend optimization (implementation planned for later)
- Key insight: System should eventually produce lab-ready recipes, not just interesting molecules

[YOUR REFLECTION HERE - How did conversations with mentors or friends influence your thinking?]

================================================================================
3. YOUR GAME PLAN
================================================================================

[YOUR REFLECTION HERE - July-August 2025: How did your idea evolve into a concrete plan? What changes did you make based on feedback?]

July 2025:
The project plan evolved from a simple molecular generator to a unified fuel design pipeline. Key architectural decisions:

1. Molecular Generator Focus:
   - Fragment-based evolution using genetic algorithms
   - Fragment-based evolution from GDB-11 database (up to 11 atoms, fuel-optimized)
   - Multi-objective fitness function balancing:
     * Molecular weight
     * Oxygen-to-carbon ratio
     * Volatility
     * Combustion potential
     * H-bonding capacity
   - Diversity preservation through Tanimoto similarity metrics
   - 100% chemical validity via RDKit validation

2. Future Vision:
   - Recognition that molecules need to work in actual blends
   - Concept of combining molecular generation with blend optimization (to be implemented later)
   - Idea for conversion module to transform molecules into blend-compatible components

August 2025:
Refinements based on early development:
- Decision to use GDB-11 instead of larger databases (better suited for fuel applications)
- Implementation of memory-efficient streaming for large fragment libraries
- Fuel-relevance filtering (C/H/O only molecules)
- Preprocessing utilities for faster fragment loading
- Focus on getting the molecular generator working well first

Key design principles established:
- Operational Realism: Future system should optimize realistic blends under real-world constraints
- Practical Integration: Novel molecules should be convertible to blend-compatible records
- Reproducibility: Future outputs should be deterministic with complete parameter capture
- End-to-End Pipeline Vision: From fragments to final blend recipes (to be fully realized when blend optimizer is added)
