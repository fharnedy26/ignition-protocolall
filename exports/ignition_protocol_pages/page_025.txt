 
Methodology 
This project integrates computational fuel design with a formally specified experimental validation framework to explore and assess novel synthetic fuel 
candidates. The methodology is structured into four primary phases: dataset preparation and molecular evolution, fitness evaluation, combustion 
fingerprint analysis, and environmental stability assessment. The computational phases were implemented using open-source cheminformatics tools, 
while the experimental components are defined as proposed protocols for future laboratory execution, together forming an end-to-end evaluation 
pipeline. 
 
1. Dataset Preparation and Fragment Cleaning 
The starting point for molecular generation was the GDB‑17 database, a systematically enumerated collection of 166 billion small organic molecules 
(Ruddigkeit et al., 2012). A random subset of 50 million SMILES strings was selected to serve as a molecular fragment base. 
The following filtering criteria were applied using RDKit in Python: 
Molecules must contain at least one carbon atom​
A minimum of four heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) was required​
Molecules must be sanitised successfully by RDKit (no valence errors or undefined stereochemistry)​
Halogen-only fragments and metal-containing species were excluded 
The cleaned fragments were saved as a flat-text SMILES file (cleaned_fragments.txt), containing approximately 12 million chemically viable fragments 
suitable for synthetic assembly. 
2. Evolutionary Generator and Molecular Construction 
A fragment-based genetic algorithm was implemented to evolve candidate fuel molecules. The algorithm functioned as follows: 
1.​
Initialisation: Random fragment pairs were selected and merged using a dummy bond placeholder. The merged structure was checked for 
chemical validity and converted to a SMILES string.​
 
2.​
Crossover and Mutation: Random substitution of fragments and mutation of bonds was introduced per generation. Invalid molecules were 
discarded.​
 
3.​
Fitness Evaluation: Each generated molecule was scored against a multi-objective fitness function (detailed below).​
 
4.​
Selection: The top-performing 10% of candidates were carried forward to the next generation using roulette and elitist selection.​
 
5.​
Diversity Preservation: Structural similarity was assessed using Morgan fingerprints and Tanimoto distance. Molecules with a similarity score 
>0.85 to others in the same generation were penalised to prevent convergence. 
The algorithm was tested on runs of 20 to 1000 generations, with output logged every 25 generations. All results were exported in .csv format, containing 
SMILES strings and associated property scores. 
3. . Combustion Testing and Fingerprint Collection 
To empirically validate candidate performance, physical flame tests are planned for top-performing prototype blends. The methodology will include: 
Combustion setup: A Bunsen or flat-flame burner will be used to burn ~1 mL samples of each fuel under identical airflow conditions 
.Flame imaging: High-frame-rate RGB video and long-exposure photography will be used to capture flame shape, colour and flicker. 
Spectral analysis: A handheld spectrometer (or smartphone with diffraction grating if necessary) will be used to collect flame spectra between 400–700 nm.
