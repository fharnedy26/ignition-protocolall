 
3.4 Regulatory Drivers: Emission Standards and Fuel Policy 
Environmental regulations have been pivotal in steering fuel development over the last 50 years. Here I outline key regulatory frameworks – such as the 
Clean Air Act and the European emission standards – and their impact on fuel requirements. Understanding these is important for my project’s rationale, as 
any new fuel must eventually comply with such standards and ideally help surpass them. U.S. Clean Air Act and EPA Regulations: In the United States, the 
Clean Air Act of 1970 set the first federal emission standards for automobiles, requiring dramatic reductions (~90%) in hydrocarbons, CO, and NOx from 
new cars by the mid-1970s. This legislation led directly to the introduction of catalytic converters in 1975 and the phase-in of unleaded gasoline (as 
mentioned earlier). Over subsequent decades, the EPA implemented increasingly strict standards (Tier 1 in the 1990s, Tier 2 in the 2000s, Tier 3 in the 
2010s) targeting lower exhaust emissions and fuel improvements. For example, the Tier 2 standards (phased in around 2004) not only tightened NOx/PM 
limits for vehicles but also mandated ultra-low sulfur gasoline and diesel – sulfur had to be reduced to under 30 ppm in gasoline and 15 ppm in highway 
diesel. This sulfur reduction was crucial to enable advanced aftertreatment systems (sulfur poisons catalysts and traps). The regulatory push for low sulfur 
effectively forced refiners to invest in better hydrotreating processes; today’s fuels are vastly cleaner in sulfur content than those of the 1980s (when diesel 
had 5000+ ppm sulfur!). Additionally, the EPA mandated reformulated gasoline (RFG) in certain polluted regions in the 1990s – these gasolines had to 
contain oxygenates (MTBE or ethanol) and had caps on volatility and aromatics to reduce smog formation. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 also 
introduced requirements for evaporative emissions, which led to lower fuel vapor pressure in summer and modifications in fuel makeup to reduce volatile 
components. As a result, modern gasoline has a tightly controlled Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) during warm months to limit evaporative smog. These 
regulations underscore that fuel is now a tightly specified product: for example, in addition to octane, one must consider legal limits on benzene (≤1% in 
U.S.), aromatics, vapor pressure, sulfur, olefins, etc. In designing a novel fuel, I am aware that even if a molecule has great performance, it cannot contain 
banned elements (no lead, of course, and in practice no sulfur, no excessive benzene) and should ideally fit into the existing regulatory framework or inspire 
updates to it. European Emission Standards (Euro 1–6 and beyond): Europe followed a similar trajectory with the Euro emissions standards for vehicles. 
Euro 1 took effect in 1992, and progressively Euro 2, 3, 4, 5, and Euro 6 (from 2014) have tightened limits on NOx, HC, CO, and PM for both gasoline and 
diesel vehicles. One notable aspect: Euro 3 and 4 pushed the adoption of diesel particulate filters (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOx on 
diesel cars, because meeting the NOx and PM limits required technology beyond just fuel changes. However, fuel quality was also addressed: Europe 
mandated widespread use of ultra-low sulfur fuel earlier than the U.S. (sulfur < 10 ppm by Euro 5). Additionally, Euro standards indirectly forced 
improvements like high cetane in diesel (to reduce PM and improve cold start) and controlled vapor pressure in gasoline (for evaporative emissions). By 
Euro 6, gasoline direct injection engines were also required to meet particle number limits, effectively forcing automakers to add particulate filters on GDI 
engines or ensure the fuel’s PMI is low enough. Currently, Euro 7 is in discussion (planned for 2025–2026) with even stricter limits, including regulation of 
previously unregulated pollutants and possibly considering life-cycle CO₂. Europe also uses fuel directives to control fuel composition (e.g., EN228 for 
gasoline, EN590 for diesel) which specify minimum octane, cetane, max sulfur, etc., in line with emission equipment needs. Thus, any new fuel component 
must be compatible with these specifications or motivate new ones. An interesting European development is the push for biofuels (the Renewable Energy 
Directive) which led to widespread use of biodiesel (FAME) and ethanol blends (E5, E10). These were driven by CO₂ reduction goals but had side effects on 
emissions (biodiesel tends to reduce PM but can increase NOx slightly, ethanol in gasoline tends to reduce CO and PM but can increase evaporative 
emissions). Policy makers had to balance those. India and Other Regions (Bharat Stage, etc.): Other countries have generally patterned their standards after 
the U.S. or EU. India, for example, leapfrogged from Bharat Stage IV to Bharat Stage VI (equivalent to Euro 6) in 2020, skipping Stage V, in response to 
severe air quality concerns. This rapid advancement necessitated immediate improvements in fuel quality (India moved to 10 ppm sulfur fuel nationwide in 
2020 to accommodate BS VI vehicles). China similarly adopted stringent China 6 standards. These global trends indicate that clean fuel is a universal 
requirement for modern engines – any novel fuel must either meet existing specifications or be so clean-burning that it eases the burden on aftertreatment 
systems. Fuel Economy and CO₂ Regulations: In recent years, regulation of greenhouse gases has indirectly influenced fuels. For instance, fuel economy (or 
CO₂ emission per km) standards push the development of fuels that enable more efficient engines (like high-octane fuels for downsized turbo engines). In 
the U.S., there was even discussion of high-octane fuel (RON 95+) becoming standard to allow further engine compression ratio increases to meet fuel 
economy standards. California has considered regulations to reduce the aromatic content of gasoline to both cut toxics and reduce soot (aromatics also 
have higher lifecycle CO₂). Additionally, some regions have carbon intensity standards (e.g., California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard) which favor fuels with 
lower lifecycle carbon emissions, thus encouraging biofuels or e-fuels. While these are not combustion properties per se, they are part of the policy 
landscape that my project exists within – if my AI can design a molecule that is not only engine-friendly but also can be made from renewable feedstock or 
has a low carbon footprint, it aligns with these emerging policies. Infrastructure and Compatibility Considerations: Regulations also ensure that new fuels 
remain compatible with engines and infrastructure. A famous example: the U.S. limited ethanol blends to 10% for decades, since higher ethanol can cause 
issues in older vehicles and fueling infrastructure. Only recently was E15 approved for many modern cars, and flex-fuel vehicles can use up to E85. Any 
truly novel fuel molecule might face a similar challenge: it would need to either be a “drop-in” fuel (chemically similar enough to gasoline or diesel to use 
existing pipelines, tanks, seals, etc.) or it would require new infrastructure and approval from standards organizations (ASTM, SAE) for use. Drop-in
