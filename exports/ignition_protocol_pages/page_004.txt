Introduction 
Synthetic fuels offer a pathway to reducing reliance on fossil energy while meeting global demand. Traditional research has focused on modifying 
known molecules, limiting exploration of chemical space. Ignition Protocol addresses this by applying evolutionary algorithms to design molecules 
from the ground up, navigating millions of structural possibilities and selecting candidates with advantageous properties.
