 
synthetic fuels (like iso-octane or other tailored hydrocarbons) have an easier path because they mimic existing fuels. I bear this in mind as a practical 
regulatory constraint – for instance, a fuel candidate with very low volatility or very high boiling point might not be acceptable as “gasoline” under 
standards (which specify a volatility range and distillation curve). Likewise, if I design an amazing fuel molecule that unfortunately degrades certain rubber 
seals or is toxic, no regulation would allow it commercially. Therefore, part of the literature review involves understanding fuel specs: gasoline must 
evaporate enough for cold start (hence a required T₁₀ temperature – the temperature at which 10% of fuel evaporates – of roughly <70°C, etc.), diesel must 
have a flash point above 52°C for safety, and so on. Table 3.1 at the end of Section 3.5 summarizes some of these standard property requirements. Meeting 
regulatory-driven specs is almost as important as achieving performance targets. In summary, environmental regulations have continually raised the bar 
for fuel quality and emissions performance. These rules have effectively eliminated harmful fuel components (lead, sulfur, high vapor toxics) and are 
driving interest in new fuels that can further cut pollutants and CO₂. My Ignition Protocol is partly motivated by this context: there is a recognized need for 
cleaner fuels to enable cleaner combustion. The project’s multi-objective goals (e.g., minimizing sooting and NOx tendencies while maximizing efficiency) 
directly align with the direction regulations have been moving. By anticipating future regulatory needs (like even lower particulate or the usage of non-fossil 
carbon), I hope the molecules discovered could be ahead of their time and support the next generation of clean combustion engines. 
3.5 Fuel Performance Metrics: Octane, Cetane, and Other Key Indices 
To quantitatively compare fuels, we use a set of well-established performance metrics. In this section, I explain the most important ones – Octane number 
(RON/MON) for spark-ignition fuels, Cetane number for diesel fuels, Heating value (energy content), and sooting indices (TSI/YSI) – as well as how they are 
measured and why they matter. These metrics form part of the “fitness function” in my AI-driven fuel design, guiding the algorithm toward 
high-performance candidates. Octane Number (Resistance to Knock): Octane number is the cornerstone metric for gasoline. It measures a fuel’s resistance 
to auto-ignition under pressure, which is critical in avoiding engine knock in spark-ignition engines. The octane scale was defined using two reference 
hydrocarbons: iso-octane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane), a highly knock-resistant fuel set to 100 octane, and n-heptane, which knocks very easily, set to 0. A 
gasoline’s Research Octane Number (RON) is determined by running it in a standard single-cylinder test engine at mild conditions and comparing its knock 
tendency to mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane. For example, if a fuel has the same knock behavior as a mixture of 90% iso-octane/10% n-heptane, its 
RON is 90. There is also a Motor Octane Number (MON) test, done at higher engine stress (higher temperature and speed), which usually yields a lower 
number. The difference RON – MON is called octane sensitivity; fuels with high sensitivity (like many alcohols and aromatics) have a significantly higher 
RON than MON. Modern pump gasoline is often rated by the average (R+M)/2 in some countries. In practice: Regular unleaded in many places has (R+M)/2 
~87 (which corresponds to RON ~91–92), while premium might be 93 (RON ~98). High octane fuel allows engines to run at higher compression ratios or 
more advanced ignition timing, which improves efficiency and power. If octane is too low for a given engine, the fuel can ignite spontaneously ahead of the 
flame front (engine knock), causing potentially severe engine damage. Knock also forces engineers to be conservative (lower compression, retarded spark 
timing), sacrificing efficiency. Therefore, a high octane number is crucial for SI engine performance. Chemically, fuel components that are high-octane 
include branched alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics, and alcohols, whereas straight-chain alkanes are low-octane. For example, iso-octane itself is 100 RON, 
while n-heptane is 0. Toluene, an aromatic, has RON ~120. Ethanol has RON around 108. This explains why refining processes that increase gasoline’s 
branching or aromatic content raise octane (but note: aromatics also increase soot, a trade-off discussed earlier). In literature, Leone et al. (2014) showed 
that fuels with high octane sensitivity can further benefit modern turbocharged engines, which operate under both mild and severe conditions. For my 
project, octane number (particularly RON) is a key target – I aim for molecules that would have high knock resistance so they could be used in advanced 
engines (like turbo or high-compression engines) without issue. I also pay attention to structural indicators of octane: e.g., incorporating branching or certain 
functional groups known to suppress knock. It’s worth noting that octane number does not correlate with energy content or combustion speed directly – it’s 
purely about auto-ignition tendency. Thus, a fuel can be high octane but have lower energy density (like ethanol). A comprehensive design needs to 
optimize multiple factors, not octane alone. Cetane Number (Ignition Quality): Cetane number is essentially the opposite of octane – it measures how 
easily a fuel ignites under compression in a diesel engine. The cetane scale uses cetane (n-hexadecane) as the high reference (defined as 100 cetane) and 
originally 1-methylnaphthalene (an aromatic) as the low reference (0 cetane, though later a different low reference with CN 15 was used for practical 
reasons). In the ASTM D613 cetane test, the fuel is run in a special engine where you vary the compression until it just ignites at a specified delay, and then 
compare that compression to reference blends. High cetane fuels ignite quickly (short ignition delay), which is desired in diesel engines for smooth 
operation. Typical diesel fuels have cetane in the 40–55 range; European specs require a minimum ~51. If cetane is too low, the fuel doesn’t ignite promptly 
upon injection; it accumulates and then auto-ignites in a big burst, causing knocking combustion and a spike in NOx. Low cetane also worsens cold start and 
increases engine noise. Molecular structure influences cetane strongly: straight-chain alkanes and some saturated compounds have high cetane (they ignite 
easily), whereas branched alkanes, cyclics, and aromatics have low cetane. For example, cetane (n-C16H34) = 100 by definition; isocetane (a highly 
branched C16) has cetane ~15; typical aromatics might have cetane near 0–20. Diesel fuel is a blend of many hydrocarbons, but refiners often add a small 
amount of cetane improver additives (like 2-ethylhexyl nitrate) to bump the cetane number if the base fuel is marginal. In my project, if I target fuels for
