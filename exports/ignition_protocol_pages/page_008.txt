 
concepts) is a compelling idea. Particulate Matter (PM) and Soot: Soot is a carbonaceous particulate produced from incomplete combustion, especially of 
heavy hydrocarbons. In engines, soot manifests as black smoke and is measured as PM (particulate matter, often quantified as PM2.5 mass or particle 
number). Diesel engines historically have high soot emissions due to their diffusion combustion – fuel is injected and burns in locally rich zones, leading to 
soot formation that is then partially oxidized. Gasoline engines were thought to be relatively soot-free until the advent of gasoline direct injection (GDI) in 
recent years, where fuel is sprayed into the chamber and can create fuel-rich pockets (leading to soot). Fuel molecular structure has a huge effect on soot 
propensity. Molecules that readily form aromatic rings during combustion tend to produce more soot. For example, benzene and other aromatics in fuel 
can survive combustion or form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are soot precursors. Long-chain high-boiling alkanes can also produce soot 
if they don’t fully break down in time. Researchers have defined metrics like the Threshold Sooting Index (TSI) and Yield Sooting Index (YSI) to quantify a 
fuel’s sooting tendency. These indices are measured in standardized ways (like smoke point tests or optical measurements of soot in a flame) and 
correlated with molecular structure. A higher TSI/YSI means the fuel is more prone to soot. Aromatics typically have high TSI; for instance, toluene has a 
high sooting index, whereas a small oxygenated molecule like ethanol has a very low sooting tendency. Kuzhagaliyeva et al. (2022) note that formulating 
fuels with low sooting propensity is key to meeting particulate emissions standards, and they cite metrics like TSI and YSI as important guides. Another 
related metric for modern fuels is the Particulate Matter Index (PMI), developed by researchers at Ford (Aikawa et al., circa 2010). PMI is a calculated index 
based on fuel composition (fraction of aromatics, double bonds, etc.) that predicts how much soot a gasoline fuel will produce in a GDI engine. A higher 
PMI indicates more soot. It’s become a useful tool for fuel designers because it captures the combined effect of multiple components. In my fuel design 
work, I aim to minimize sooting tendency, which typically means favoring molecules that are highly hydrogenated (high H/C ratio), avoid multi-ring 
structures, and possibly include oxygen (which tends to interrupt soot formation pathways). Studies have shown that adding oxygenates to fuel reduces 
soot: e.g., adding ethanol or biodiesel (which contain oxygen) to diesel significantly cuts soot emissions. This is partly because oxygenates produce more 
radicals that oxidize soot and partly because they dilute the carbon density of the blend. My literature review also uncovered an interesting strategy: fuel 
water emulsions (as mentioned above). When water is finely dispersed in fuel, as the fuel burns the water can vaporize explosively (micro-explosions), 
shattering fuel droplets and improving mixing, which leads to more complete combustion and less soot. While I do not plan to put water in my designed 
molecules, this concept underscores the value of fuels that either vaporize well or otherwise enhance mixing. Another advanced concept is 
low-temperature combustion (LTC) modes in engines (discussed in Section 3.10) where the goal is to avoid the high-temp rich pockets that form soot – but 
achieving LTC can depend on fuel characteristics as well. In summary, soot formation is a major constraint in fuel design: fuels must be formulated to 
minimize heavy, aromatic, or unsaturated components that lead to soot. My Ignition Protocol explicitly includes a fitness term for sooting index, penalizing 
molecules likely to produce soot. Aldehydes and Other Toxic Byproducts: Beyond the main regulated pollutants (CO, NOx, PM, and hydrocarbons), fuels 
can produce other hazardous emissions. Aldehydes (like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) are produced especially from oxygenated fuels. For example, 
ethanol combustion can produce acetaldehyde; methanol can produce formaldehyde if oxidation stops partway. Diesel engines, especially in cold 
conditions or under LTC regimes, also emit formaldehyde as a product of cool-flame chemistry. These aldehydes are irritants and potentially carcinogenic. 
Fuel structure influences which aldehydes form: fuels with ethanol will inherently have some acetaldehyde in the exhaust (though catalysts can mitigate 
this). Another byproduct is benzene (a known carcinogen), often present as unburned fuel if gasoline contains benzene or via decomposition of other 
aromatics. Modern gasoline regulations limit benzene content strictly to reduce this risk. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can also be emitted 
(some attach to soot particles) – these come from aromatic fuel components or via soot chemistry. While my project’s main focus isn’t emissions 
toxicology, I acknowledge that a “clean” fuel must also consider these secondary pollutants. Generally, designing fuels to minimize soot and ensure 
complete combustion also helps reduce most toxic byproducts. If a fuel burns very completely (low UHC) and has minimal aromatics (reducing PAH 
formation), then aldehydes and toxics will be lower. There is one caveat: some high-octane biofuels like butanol can produce more aldehydes than 
gasoline, even as they cut soot and CO. Thus, any new fuel must be tested for such emissions. In literature, advanced optical diagnostics have been used to 
detect intermediate species like formaldehyde in flames. For example, Li et al. (2016) used a laser-based technique to identify multiple intermediates in 
alcohol fuel flames, demonstrating the complex chemistry that can occur. This level of analysis may be beyond a typical fuel screening, but it shows that 
even “invisible” emissions (like gaseous aldehydes) are considered by researchers. In conclusion, emissions chemistry is a driving force behind fuel 
innovation. Fuels historically were optimized mostly for performance, but since the 1970s the need to reduce NOx, CO, soot, and other pollutants has 
drastically reshaped fuel formulations (e.g. unleaded, low-sulfur, oxygenated gasoline, biodiesel blends). In Ignition Protocol, I incorporate 
emissions-related criteria (like sooting index, oxygen content, etc.) into my AI’s fitness function explicitly, to ensure the candidate fuels are not just 
high-performing, but also environmentally superior.
