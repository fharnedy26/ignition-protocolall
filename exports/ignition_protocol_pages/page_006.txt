To design and evaluate fuels, you must understand basic combustion science. Here I outline key concepts such as the stoichiometric mixture, ignition 
behavior, and flame propagation – all of which influence engine performance and emissions. Stoichiometric Air-Fuel Ratio: Every fuel has a stoichiometric 
air-fuel ratio (AFR), which is the precise mass ratio of air to fuel needed for complete combustion (with no leftover oxygen or fuel). This ratio depends on 
the fuel’s elemental makeup (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen content). For example, gasoline (approximated as C_7H_16) has a stoichiometric AFR of about 
14.7:1 (meaning ~14.7 kg of air per 1 kg of fuel). Diesel fuel, with a similar C/H ratio, is around 14.5:1. Oxygenated fuels have a lower stoichiometric AFR 
because the fuel itself contributes oxygen. Ethanol (C_2H_5OH), for instance, has a stoichiometric AFR near 9:1, much lower than gasoline. This is 
important because it affects how the fuel burns in engines. In a spark-ignition engine, the mixture is often controlled at or near stoichiometric for best 
performance and to allow catalytic converters to function (they need a roughly stoichiometric exhaust). If the mixture is rich (too little air), combustion 
leaves fuel unoxidized, causing carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. If the mixture is lean (excess air), combustion can be more 
complete (less CO/UHC), but very lean mixtures can misfire or, in some cases, lead to high nitrogen oxides due to high combustion temperatures. The 
presence of oxygen in the fuel can help ensure more complete combustion in situations like cold starts, where engines deliberately run rich. Historically, 
additives like MTBE and ethanol were added to gasoline in the 1990s to oxygenate fuel and reduce CO emissions in cities. In my project, I consider 
molecules with built-in oxygen (like alcohol functional groups) beneficial from an emissions standpoint: oxygenated fuels “carry their own oxygen”, 
potentially reducing incomplete combustion by enabling leaner combustion or by oxidizing soot precursors internally. However, as noted, oxygenated fuels 
also tend to have lower energy content (because the oxygenated part of the molecule does not release energy), so there is a trade-off addressed later in 
Section 3.6. Ignition Delay and Auto-Ignition: Ignition behavior is crucial for engine compatibility. In spark-ignition (SI) engines (gasoline), we actually want 
to avoid auto-ignition of the fuel-air mixture until the spark plug fires – this property is quantified by octane number (discussed later). In 
compression-ignition (CI) engines (diesel), we rely on auto-ignition of fuel injected into hot air – quantified by cetane number. The time between fuel 
injection and the start of combustion in a diesel is called ignition delay. A short ignition delay (high cetane fuel) results in a smoother, controlled burn; a 
long delay (low cetane) leads to a larger amount of premixed fuel igniting at once, causing a violent pressure spike known as “diesel knock” and high NOx 
formation. From a fundamentals perspective, auto-ignition chemistry is governed by the fuel’s molecular structure and the conditions (temperature, 
pressure). Straight-chain alkanes ignite easily (why hexadecane was defined as cetane = 100), whereas highly branched or aromatic molecules resist 
ignition. I leverage these principles: for instance, if I design a fuel for a diesel application, I would seek molecular features that promote quick ignition (linear 
alkyl chains, perhaps with nitrate functional groups as in some cetane improvers). For spark-ignition fuels, I want the opposite: molecules that are resistant 
to ignition (branched chains, aromatics, certain ethers) to prevent premature knock. The detailed kinetics of auto-ignition are complex, involving 
low-temperature oxidation pathways and radical chain reactions, but a basic understanding is captured by octane/cetane ratings used in engine tests. 
Laminar Flame Speed: Once ignition occurs (either by spark or auto-ignition), the flame propagates through the fuel-air mixture. The laminar flame speed 
is the speed at which an unstretched flame front travels through a quiescent premixed gas. It is a fundamental property of the fuel-air mixture. Typical 
laminar flame speeds for stoichiometric gasoline-air are on the order of 30–40 cm/s. Hydrogen has an exceptionally high flame speed (~200 cm/s), while 
heavier hydrocarbons and especially fuels with high aromatic content burn slower. In an engine, faster flame speed (up to a point) is beneficial because it 
means the combustion can complete closer to the optimal timing (around top-dead-center of the piston). If a fuel’s flame speed is too slow, combustion 
may continue late into the expansion stroke, causing a loss of efficiency and more unburnt fuel emissions. Very slow combustion can also force designers to 
run engines at less aggressive conditions (to avoid misfire or knock onset due to partial burns). If flame speed is extremely high (approaching a detonation), 
that’s essentially knock – which we avoid in SI engines. In my literature review, I found that flame speed correlates with molecular structure: fuels with 
simpler, reactive structures (like small olefins or highly branched alkanes) tend to burn faster than large aromatics. Thus, if designing fuels for lean or 
high-EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) combustion strategies, one might favor components with higher flame speeds to sustain stable combustion in dilute 
mixtures. Modern researchers often calculate or measure laminar flame speeds for novel fuel candidates to ensure they will combust rapidly enough in an 
engine. Combustion Temperature and Flame Chemistry: Another fundamental aspect is flame temperature, which is mainly a function of the fuel’s heat 
release and mixture stoichiometry. Stoichiometric combustion of most hydrocarbon fuels yields flame temperatures around 2000–2300 K. Higher flame 
temperatures promote the formation of thermal NOx (discussed in Section 3.3). Fuels containing certain functional groups (like alcohols) can have slightly 
different adiabatic flame temperatures due to their oxygen content and lower heating value – often resulting in a cooler flame at stoichiometric conditions. 
Additionally, flame chemistry determines the production of intermediate radicals and soot precursors. Fuels that decompose into small fragments (like 
short-chain alkanes) tend to produce fewer sooting precursors than fuels that readily form ring structures (aromatics). These chemical tendencies will be 
explored more under emissions (Section 3.3). In summary, the basics of combustion science – the proportion of air needed, the ease of ignition, the speed 
of flame propagation, and the resultant temperatures – are all crucial for evaluating a potential fuel. As I design new molecules, I must consider how these 
properties will play out: e.g., will the molecule likely ignite too soon or not soon enough? Will it burn fast and clean, or slow and smokily? By grounding my
