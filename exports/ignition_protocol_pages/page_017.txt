 
Parameterization: Typically 2–3 seed molecules to provide some structural diversity at the start. We allow 2 or 3 generations of mutations (in our tests we 
used 3 generations for a deeper search). The branching factor is moderate to high – each molecule could spawn several new ones – but we may impose a 
limit per generation to avoid runaway growth (for example, we might only take the top N candidates at each generation to continue expanding, a form of 
heuristic pruning). 
Estimated candidate count: On the order of 10^3–10^4. For instance, with 3 seeds and 3 generations, even a modest branching (say ~5 children per 
molecule per generation) could yield: generation 1 ~15 children, generation 2 ~75, generation 3 ~375, plus earlier ones summing to a few hundred. In less 
constrained expansion it could reach a few thousand. We anticipated a low thousands range of total candidates. 
Actual candidates processed: In our Classroom profile run, roughly 3,000–5,000 molecules were generated and evaluated in total. We observed that the 
filtering steps removed a good portion of intermediate candidates (especially by generation 3 many unlikely structures were filtered out), which kept the 
final count toward the lower end of the range. Still, this was a substantial increase in workload compared to Demo. 
Execution time: This profile’s runtime is on the order of minutes. On the i7-8700 system, the Classroom run completed in about 60 seconds (1 minute). On 
the i5-12th Gen system, the same run took approximately 45 seconds. The newer System B maintained roughly a 25% faster execution, finishing the job in 
under a minute. These times were comfortably within what we’d consider acceptable for an interactive classroom demo (where a one-minute wait is 
reasonable for students, whereas 10+ minutes would be too slow). 
With thousands of candidates explored, the engine had more opportunity to find high-scoring molecules. The top 8 results from the Classroom profile run 
are shown below. These likely include even more complex or optimized structures (for example, larger hydrocarbons, possibly polycyclic structures or ones 
including oxygenated fragments if those survived filtering and improved the score). The diversity and quality of top molecules here underscore that a 
broader search can yield better-scoring candidates – but again, our focus is that the engine handled this larger search within a short time.

Table: Top eight candidates from the Classroom profile. These include some larger and more unusual structures made possible by deeper mutation 
generations (e.g., the presence of an –O– linker in some candidates, multiple branching, or a cyclic backbone). The scores are higher on average than in the 
Demo run, reflecting that a wider search found candidates more closely matching the surrogate optimal criteria. 
Light Stress Profile 
Moving into the overt stress-test category, the Light Stress profile significantly ramps up the workload to test the engine’s performance limits. This profile is 
not something one would run for casual use; it is specifically to push more data through the pipeline and observe how the system copes.
