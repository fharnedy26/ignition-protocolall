 
Monte Carlo Method​
 A probabilistic technique used in some molecular generation algorithms. Random moves are accepted or rejected based on a statistical rule, often used for 
sampling or energy minimisation. 
 
Combustion and Flame Testing 
Combustion Fingerprint​
 A unique profile generated by a fuel during burning. It includes flame colour, shape, flicker frequency and spectral emissions. These characteristics are 
used to distinguish between fuels and infer chemical composition. 
Flame Spectrum / Spectroscopy​
 The breakdown of light emitted by a flame into specific wavelengths. Each fuel produces characteristic peaks in the visible or near-infrared range, which 
correspond to excited molecules like CH, C₂ or CN. 
Flame Flicker Analysis (FFT)​
 Measuring the brightness fluctuations of a flame over time and applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to identify dominant frequency components. Can 
reveal turbulence, flame stability and combustion quality. 
Chemiluminescence​
 Light emitted by chemical reactions in the flame, often in specific colours depending on the fuel. For example, CH radicals emit blue light, while C₂ can 
emit green. 
Microexplosion​
 A phenomenon where an emulsified water droplet inside a fuel droplet superheats and explosively vaporises, shattering the droplet into finer particles. 
This enhances atomisation and combustion efficiency. 
 
 Environmental Testing and Degradability 
Biodegradability​
 The ability of a fuel or chemical to break down in the environment, especially through microbial metabolism. Readily biodegradable compounds are less 
persistent and pose lower ecological risks. 
Microbial Stability / Fuel Spoilage​
 The resistance of a fuel to microbial growth and decomposition during storage. Biofuels, especially those with oxygenated groups, may be more prone to 
spoilage unless stabilised. 
Soil Slurry Assay​
 An experimental setup used in this project to test biodegradability. Fuel samples are mixed with soil and water and observed over time for signs of 
microbial growth, odour changes or phase separation. 
Co-Metabolism​
 A microbial process where one compound (e.g. biodiesel) stimulates the breakdown of another, more persistent compound (e.g. petrodiesel). Important for 
understanding how fuel blends degrade in the environment. 
OECD Biodegradability Criteria​
 Standardised tests to determine whether a substance is “readily biodegradable” (typically >60% degraded in 28 days) or only partially degradable. 
Common in environmental risk assessments of fuels.
