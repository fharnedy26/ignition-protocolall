 
compression ignition, I would optimize for high cetane. However, designing a single molecule for high cetane might conflict with other goals like high octane 
or low soot, because as noted, the characteristics diverge (straight chains = high cetane but low octane and high soot; aromatics = high octane but low 
cetane and high soot). One possible strategy the literature suggests is dual-fuel approaches or tailored blends – but Ignition Protocol focuses on single 
molecules or formulations that try to satisfy multiple objectives at once. For this literature review, suffice it to say cetane number is the key metric for 
diesel compatibility and I must be mindful of it for any fuel intended to run in a diesel engine or in advanced compression ignition modes like HCCI (which 
often require a certain ignition reactivity). It’s interesting to note the fuel landscape: gasoline wants high octane & low cetane; diesel wants high cetane & 
(effectively) low octane. These are opposite requirements, which is one reason we have fundamentally different fuels for the two engine types. However, 
new combustion modes (discussed in Section 3.10) sometimes blur this line – e.g., some advanced engines might need fuels with intermediate properties 
(not as extreme as gasoline or diesel). That opens the door to novel fuel formulations that aren’t constrained by the traditional definitions. Researchers 
Venkatasubramanian et al. (2002) even used neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to design fuel additives that could improve both octane and 
cetane in their respective fuels, highlighting AI’s potential in navigating these complex trade-offs. Energy Content (Heating Value): The energy density of a 
fuel – often given as Lower Heating Value (LHV) in MJ/kg or MJ/L – directly affects vehicle range and efficiency. A higher LHV means each kilogram or liter 
of fuel contains more energy, so less fuel is needed for the same engine output (assuming engine efficiency is constant). Diesel fuel has an LHV around 
42–43 MJ/kg and because diesel is denser (~0.84 g/mL), it’s about 36 MJ/L. Gasoline has ~44 MJ/kg but a lower density (~0.75 g/mL for typical gasoline), 
giving ~32 MJ/L. Thus diesel contains roughly 10–15% more energy per liter than gasoline, which partly explains why diesel vehicles get better fuel 
economy. Oxygenated fuels have lower energy content: ethanol is about 26–27 MJ/kg and ~21 MJ/L, due to the oxygen atom in its structure carrying “dead 
weight” (oxygen is already oxidized). From an engine perspective, lower energy content means you must inject more volume of fuel for the same power. 
This can be a limitation (e.g., E85 ethanol flex-fuel vehicles require larger fuel injectors to supply enough fuel). However, energy content alone doesn’t tell 
the whole story – it interacts with efficiency. For example, although ethanol has ~33% less energy per liter than gasoline, it can enable higher engine 
efficiency (through octane and charge cooling), so the effective mileage penalty is less than 33%. In my design work, I include LHV as a factor because 
ultimately a fuel that delivers very low energy per liter would severely hurt range and consumer acceptance. If I design some highly oxygenated molecule, I 
need to be aware of that trade-off. Generally, I seek fuels with energy content comparable to or higher than conventional fuels. Some studies (like Whitney, 
2011) have discussed how oxygenated high-octane fuels can still yield competitive efficiency because the engine can be tuned to extract more work. 
There’s also a distinction between mass-based and volumetric energy density that matters depending on the application: for vehicles, volumetric (MJ/L) is 
often more critical (fuel tank size is limited), whereas for aviation, both mass and volume are critical (and weight is at a premium, so MJ/kg might matter 
more). To illustrate typical values and differences, I compiled a comparison in Table 3.1 for gasoline, diesel, and ethanol. Flame Speed and Combustion 
Indices: Although not always given as a single “metric” on spec sheets, laminar flame speed (discussed in Section 3.2) can be considered a performance 
indicator. Sometimes fuels are rated by how well they maintain stability in lean combustion – one could think of a “lean misfire limit” or “dilution 
tolerance” as metrics. For instance, fuel additives like hydrogen or acetylene have been tested to improve flame speed and stability of lean mixtures. In my 
project’s context, I don’t assign a numeric target for flame speed, but I consider it qualitatively: a candidate fuel that likely has an extremely low flame 
speed might be penalized because it could lead to incomplete combustion in real engines. There are experimental metrics like the Maronne index (for lean 
combustion limits) or even simple data on flame speeds at certain conditions that can be predicted by detailed kinetics. For cutting-edge fuels, some 
researchers directly simulate combustion to ensure flame speeds are acceptable (e.g. Fleitmann et al. (2023) in designing fuels for maximum SI engine 
efficiency had to ensure the candidate molecules would actually burn in a timely manner). Sooting Indices (TSI, YSI, PMI): I already touched on these under 
emissions, but to recap as metrics: Threshold Sooting Index (TSI) is often measured by the smoke point height of a flame – basically how long a wick flame 
can burn without smoking. It’s scaled such that a higher number means more sooting tendency. Yield Sooting Index (YSI) is a newer metric that measures 
actual soot volume fraction in a flame under standardized conditions; it’s considered more precise for aromatics. These indices give a number that fuel 
designers can aim to minimize. A fuel with TSI of, say, 10 would be extremely clean (perhaps an oxygenated fuel), whereas a fuel with TSI of 50+ would be 
very sooty (like a heavy aromatic fuel). Particulate Matter Index (PMI), specific to gasoline formulations, is calculated from the fuel’s composition (taking 
into account fraction of aromatics, double bonds, etc., and their respective weighting factors) and correlates with the particulate emissions in modern 
engines. It’s unitless; typical regular gasoline might have a PMI ~1.5–2.5, whereas a very low-aromatic gasoline or an ethanol blend could have PMI <1. For 
perspective, Aikawa et al. found that reducing total aromatics and especially heavy aromatics in fuel has a strong effect on lowering PMI. In my fitness 
function, I effectively include sooting tendency by using a Threshold Sooting Index predictor (based on molecular structure). According to Kuzhagaliyeva et 
al. (2022), modern AI fuel design can incorporate such models to target low sooting fuels. Thus, TSI/YSI/PMI are part of how I quantify “cleanliness” of 
combustion for candidate molecules.
