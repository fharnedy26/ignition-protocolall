 
Each fuel’s combustion “fingerprint” will be extracted using: 
Colour histograms (from video frames)​
FFT of flame flicker frequency (temporal intensity variation)​
Peak detection in spectral lines (noting CH, C₂ and CN emissions) 
Principal component analysis (PCA) will be applied to visualise cluster separation between combustion fingerprints and to identify distinguishing spectral or 
temporal patterns. 
4. Microbial Biodegradability and Storage Stability Tests 
To assess environmental compatibility, biodegradability and microbial growth assays are planned for selected fuel candidates: 
●​
Setup: ~10 mL of each prototype blend will be mixed into a sterilised soil slurry (soil + water in a 1:2 ratio). 
●​
Incubation: Samples will be stored at room temperature for 7–10 days and observed daily. 
●​
Observations to be recorded: 
○​
Biofilm formation or surface growth 
○​
Odour changes indicating microbial metabolism 
○​
pH shifts using litmus and indicator strips 
○​
Visual signs of separation, emulsification or spoilage 
Comparison was made between synthetic fuels, known biodiesels, and fossil diesel to gauge relative stability and degradation.
