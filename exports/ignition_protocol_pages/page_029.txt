 
Two caveats should be acknowledged. First, the current fitness function estimates combustion cleanliness from simple structural proxies (O:C, ring index). 
Real combustion chemistry is far more nuanced. Second, synthetic feasibility was enforced only by a binary machine-learned classifier. Although this filter 
excludes unmakeable molecules, it does not guarantee economical synthesis routes. Collaboration with a synthetic chemist will therefore be essential 
before any laboratory-scale production. 
Pending flame-testing data will confirm whether the predicted clean-burning behaviour manifests in practice. Similarly, microbial assays will verify if the 
slight increase in oxygenation translates into improved biodegradability relative to reference fossil fuels. 
 
 
 
8 Conclusion 
This project has successfully built an end-to-end digital pipeline that designs, ranks and prepares novel synthetic fuel candidates for experimental 
validation. A cleaned subset of the GDB-17 universe provided more than twelve million fragments; a genetic algorithm evolved these fragments over one 
thousand generations, guided by a multi-objective fitness function. The final population achieves a high composite fitness, balanced volatility and a 
modestly improved oxygen-to-carbon ratio. 
Upcoming experimental work will supply physical evidence for combustion fingerprints and environmental compatibility. If empirical results align with 
predictions, the Ignition Protocol framework could serve as a template for data-driven fuel discovery, reducing reliance on trial-and-error methods in 
sustainable energy research. 
Future extensions include quantum-chemical enthalpy calculations to refine energy-density estimates, integration of lifecycle emissions metrics, and 
collaboration with engine modellers to co-optimise fuel–engine systems. 
 
 
 
Glossary 
 Chemical and Molecular Terms 
SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System)​
 A compact way to represent a chemical structure using plain text. Each atom and bond is encoded as a string (e.g. CCO for ethanol). SMILES strings are 
essential for computational molecule design and are used throughout cheminformatics software. 
Molecular Fragment​
 A chemically valid substructure or partial molecule used as a building block. In this project, fragments from the GDB‑17 database are randomly combined 
to evolve larger, fuel-like molecules. 
GDB‑17​
 A generated database of 166 billion possible small organic molecules containing up to 17 heavy atoms (non-hydrogen). Designed to cover the full chemical 
space of stable, drug- or fuel-relevant compounds (Ruddigkeit et al., 2012).
