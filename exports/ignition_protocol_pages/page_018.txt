 
Parameterization: We increased both the number of seeds and the generation depth. For example, 5 seed molecules were used, and 3–4 generations of 
mutations were allowed. The branching factor was higher – we did not tightly cap the number of mutations per molecule, allowing the combinatorial 
expansion to proceed more freely (though the filters still cut down infeasible growth). We might also allow a larger fragment library or more positions for 
attachment to further increase the variety. 
Estimated candidate count: On the order of 10^4–10^5. With multiple seeds and up to 4 generations, if each molecule on average yielded ~4–5 children, 
the growth could be dramatic. A rough ballpark: generation 1 (5 seeds → ~25 children), generation 2 (~125 children), generation 3 (~625), generation 4 could 
approach ~3000+ new candidates, summing to perhaps ~4000+. However, with 5 separate seed lineages, and higher branching or fragment options, the 
total could easily reach tens of thousands. We expected somewhere between 10,000 and 50,000 candidates might be processed in this profile. 
Actual candidates processed: The Light Stress run produced on the order of 50,000 candidate molecules that passed through filtering and scoring. This 
indicates that the combination of multiple seeds and multiple generations with less restriction indeed led to a large pool. The filters removed a huge 
number of raw generated structures (for example, over 100k were generated before filtering, but only ~50k survived basic validity and heuristic filters to 
be scored). 
Execution time: This larger workload resulted in a multi-minute runtime. On System A (i7-8700), the Light Stress profile completed in approximately 300 
seconds (5 minutes). On System B, we measured roughly 220 seconds (~3.7 minutes) for the same task. The newer system was about 35–40% faster here, 
a slightly bigger relative advantage than in smaller profiles. This could be due to better utilization of CPU caches or parallel resources when handling large 
loops, but in any case, both runs were under 6 minutes, demonstrating that even tens of thousands of molecules can be handled in a matter of minutes by 
the engine. 
The top 8 molecules from the Light Stress run are listed below. With this profile’s much broader search (tens of thousands of candidates explored), the 
highest-scoring molecules are likely quite optimized toward the scoring criteria. They may include larger structures, multiple functional groups, or 
edge-case combinations that barely passed filters (since the search went far). We begin to see how increased search effort can uncover molecules with 
significantly higher surrogate scores than earlier profiles did.

Table: Top eight candidates from the Light Stress profile. These SMILES strings represent highly branched and/or cyclic hydrocarbons with possible oxygen 
substitutions that scored very well. The complexity of these top candidates reflects the much larger search space explored in Light Stress – the engine 
found molecules with nearly optimal surrogate scores (for the given heuristics) once tens of thousands of possibilities were examined.
