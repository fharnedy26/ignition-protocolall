 
The evolutionary engine was initialised with a set of ten simple, oxygenated base molecules, as shown above. These included short-chain alcohols, ethers, 
esters and alkenyl alcohols, chosen for their fuel relevance and structural simplicity. These fragments serve as the building blocks for larger, more complex 
molecules in the generator. The selection aimed to capture a range of functional groups known to influence combustion, volatility and biodegradability. 
Their presence promotes diversity in the resulting molecular structures and supports chemically reasonable crossover and mutation operations in the 
generator. 
6.2. Evolved Molecules After 20 Generations 
 
Following twenty generations of crossover, mutation and fitness-based selection, the population exhibits clear growth in structural complexity (Figure 6-2). 
Saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains have combined with the original oxygenated motifs to yield esters, ethers and alkenyl esters with one or 
two rings. Median molecular weight has risen to 128 g mol⁻¹, while the mean oxygen-to-carbon ratio has climbed from 0.10 to 0.12. Importantly, the ring 
count distribution remains centred on one, demonstrating that the ring-penalty component of the fitness function is preventing runaway aromaticity. Many 
of these generation-20 molecules already fall within the desired window for spark-ignition fuels: logP 2 – 4, molecular weight 110 – 150 g mol⁻¹ and zero 
halogens. Taken together, these observations show that the early evolutionary pressure successfully moves the population toward fuel-relevant regions of 
chemical space without sacrificing chemical validity.
