Literature Review 
In this section, I review the scientific and engineering foundations relevant to the Ignition Protocol, an AI-driven engine for novel fuel discovery. I cover the 
historical development of fuels, fundamentals of combustion and emissions chemistry, regulatory drivers, key fuel performance metrics, advanced engine 
combustion modes, and the state-of-the-art in applying artificial intelligence to fuel design. I also discuss experimental combustion diagnostics, 
environmental considerations, synthesis feasibility, and broader policy context. Throughout, I connect these topics to justify the approach taken in my 
project. I write from a first-person perspective, reflecting my understanding of the literature and how it guides my research. 
3.1 Historical Development of Gasoline and Diesel Fuels 
Early Gasoline and Internal Combustion Engines: Gasoline emerged in the late 19th century as a volatile petroleum byproduct that found use in newly 
invented internal combustion engines. Early gasoline was essentially a surplus from kerosene refining (kerosene was used for lamps), but innovators like 
Nikolaus Otto and Gottlieb Daimler recognized that these light hydrocarbons could fuel efficient spark-ignition engines. By the 1880s–1890s, 
gasoline-fueled engines powered the first automobiles. Initially, fuel quality was inconsistent; engines had low compression and very basic carburetion, 
tolerating the available gasoline. Over time, refining processes improved to increase gasoline’s quality and consistency, guided by growing understanding of 
fuel chemistry and engine requirements. Rudolf Diesel and the Birth of Diesel Fuel: In 1897, Rudolf Diesel demonstrated the first compression-ignition 
engine, initially using peanut oil as fuel. This engine relied on auto-ignition of the fuel under high pressure rather than a spark. As diesel engines became 
commercial (early 20th century), the petroleum industry introduced diesel fuel, a heavier distillate than gasoline. Diesel fuel’s properties differed 
significantly: it needed to ignite quickly upon injection rather than resist ignition. Early diesel fuels were not highly refined – often just a fraction of crude oil 
– but over decades fuel standards improved to ensure sufficient ignition quality (cetane) and consistent performance. The concept of cetane number 
(ignition quality rating) was developed in the 1930s to quantify how readily a diesel fuel ignites (analogous to octane rating for gasoline, but essentially the 
inverse property). I discuss octane and cetane in detail in Section 3.5. Tetraethyl Lead and Octane Enhancement: A major historical milestone was the 
introduction of tetraethyl lead (TEL) in the 1920s as an anti-knock additive for gasoline. As engines in the 1910s–20s began to use higher compression 
ratios for efficiency, knocking (uncontrolled combustion) became a serious problem. In 1921, Thomas Midgley discovered that adding minute amounts of 
TEL dramatically raised the fuel’s octane rating (knock resistance). For decades, leaded gasoline became the norm worldwide, enabling more powerful 
engines. However, by the 1970s the severe toxicity and environmental pollution from lead became clear. This led to one of the most significant shifts in fuel 
policy: unleaded gasoline was introduced and progressively mandated. In the United States, the 1970 Clean Air Act and subsequent regulations forced the 
phase-out of lead, primarily because catalytic converters (required to reduce emissions) are poisoned by lead deposits. By the mid-1980s, leaded fuel had 
been largely eliminated in the U.S. (and later in Europe and other regions by the 1990s) in favor of unleaded, along with a reduction in compression ratios 
or the use of alternative octane boosters. Emergence of High-Octane Blending Components: Post-LEAD era, refineries began producing higher-octane 
gasoline through reforming processes (to create aromatics) and used alternative additives. For example, MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) and later ethanol 
were used as octane boosters in the 1980s–2000s, which also had the benefit of adding oxygen to fuel (helping reduce carbon monoxide emissions). 
These changes were driven by both performance needs and environmental regulations (as discussed later in Section 3.4). Historical Diesel Fuel 
Developments: Diesel fuel quality improvements historically focused on cold-weather performance and cetane. In early years, diesel engines could be 
finicky, with hard starting and smoke. Over time, refiners increased the cetane number by improving distillation and incorporating additives (e.g. alkyl 
nitrates) to ensure diesel ignites promptly in engines. Another historical issue was high sulfur content in both gasoline and diesel; sulfur contributes to 
engine deposits and, when combusted, forms SOx emissions. We later reduced sulfur drastically (toward ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and low-sulfur 
gasoline) as part of emissions control programs in the 2000s. This shift is a crucial enabler for catalytic aftertreatment systems and is discussed further 
under regulations. In summary, the early development of automotive fuels was a process of trial-and-error coupled with scientific progress in chemistry 
and engine engineering. By the mid-20th century, fuel formulations had evolved (e.g. leaded high-octane gasoline and adequate cetane diesel) to meet 
performance demands of the day. However, the latter half of the 20th century saw a new driver for fuel innovation: air pollution and public health, which 
led to cleaner fuels and new fuel blends. The next sections will cover how combustion chemistry and emission concerns necessitated these changes, and 
how regulatory frameworks pushed fuel technology forward.
