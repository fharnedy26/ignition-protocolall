standpoint. 
3.3 Emissions Chemistry: NOx, Soot, CO, CO₂, and Aldehydes 
Burning fuel in engines produces a variety of chemical emissions. One of my core motivations for seeking new fuels was to reduce harmful emissions while 
maintaining performance. Here I review how different pollutants form during combustion and how fuel properties influence them. Carbon Dioxide (CO₂): 
CO₂ is the end-product of complete combustion of carbon in the fuel. While not toxic, CO₂ is the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change. The 
amount of CO₂ emitted is directly related to the fuel’s carbon content and how much fuel is burned (thus indirectly related to engine efficiency). Fuel 
design alone can’t eliminate CO₂ – any hydrocarbon or alcohol fuel will produce CO₂ if fully burned. However, fuels with higher hydrogen content (or with 
oxygen content enabling leaner burn) produce slightly less CO₂ per unit energy. For example, ethanol (C₂H₅OH) has a lower carbon-to-hydrogen ratio than 
octane (C₈H₁₈), so per unit energy, ethanol generates less CO₂ (some of the energy comes from forming water). Additionally, if a fuel allows higher efficiency 
(e.g., higher compression ratio due to high octane), the vehicle will burn less fuel for the same work, reducing net CO₂. In my project, I am not directly 
optimizing for CO₂ emissions (since that’s largely an outcome of carbon content and efficiency), but I prioritize high energy density and engine efficiency 
which indirectly helps minimize CO₂ per km. Ultimately, addressing CO₂ may require using bio-derived or synthetic fuels made from CO₂ (so the carbon is 
recycled), but that’s a broader life-cycle issue beyond the combustion chemistry focus of Ignition Protocol. Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Unburned 
Hydrocarbons (UHC): CO and UHC result from incomplete combustion. CO forms if there is insufficient oxygen or insufficient time to fully oxidize carbon 
to CO₂. UHC (which can be thought of as droplets or pockets of fuel that never fully burned, or intermediate hydrocarbons like methane, ethylene, etc.) 
occur for similar reasons. In gasoline SI engines, CO and UHC emissions are highest during rich operation (such as cold start or full throttle) when the 
mixture deliberately has excess fuel. Modern engines use catalytic converters to oxidize CO and UHC into CO₂ and water after combustion. Diesel engines 
typically run lean (excess oxygen), so they emit relatively low CO, but can still emit UHC (often visible as white vapor or smell of unburned diesel, 
especially at cold start or idle). Fuel properties influence these emissions: a fuel with high volatility and good mixability will vaporize and mix thoroughly, 
leaving fewer liquid droplets or pockets to burn incompletely. A fuel with oxygen content (like oxygenates) tends to produce less CO/UHC because even if 
the local mixture is rich, the fuel itself provides some oxygen to help complete the reaction. Historically, cities with CO pollution problems turned to 
oxygenated fuels; for example, adding 10% ethanol to gasoline can significantly cut CO emissions in older engines by leaning out the mixture and 
promoting complete oxidation. In my literature review, I found that the stoichiometric requirement plays a role: fuels that require a very rich mixture for 
stability will inevitably create more CO/UHC. Therefore, one aim in fuel design is to favor fuels that either allow leaner operation or inherently combust 
more completely. Also, reducing heavy high-boiling components in fuel can reduce UHC, because heavy molecules may survive combustion partially or 
burn slowly. New synthetic fuels that are tailored to have only easily vaporized, clean-burning components could drastically reduce engine-out CO and 
hydrocarbon emissions (aside from cold start, which is a special case needing engine strategies like heating or spark timing). Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): NOx (a 
mix of NO and NO₂) forms when nitrogen and oxygen in the air react at the high temperatures of combustion. In engines, the thermal NOx mechanism is 
dominant: above ~1800 K, atmospheric N₂ can oxidize to NO. Thus, peak combustion temperature and oxygen availability largely govern NOx formation. 
SI gasoline engines typically operate near stoichiometric and have flame temperatures around 2200 K, producing significant NOx, which is then cleaned by 
a three-way catalyst. Diesel engines run lean and at high compression, often producing even more NOx because of high combustion temperatures in 
localized zones. Fuel influences NOx in a few ways. First, any fuel property or engine condition that lowers peak temperatures will reduce NOx. For 
instance, high heat-of-vaporization fuels (like alcohols) cool the charge significantly during evaporation, which can lower combustion temperatures and 
NOx. Water content in fuel (as in emulsified fuels or water injection) also cools combustion. In fact, experiments have shown that adding water to the 
combustion process can cut NOx dramatically by absorbing heat. Gollahalli (1983) and Hsuan et al. (2019) observed reduced NOx emissions when using 
water-in-fuel emulsions in combustion systems. Second, fuel-derived chemistry effects can alter NOx: fuels containing bound nitrogen (not common for 
most fuels, except some biofuels or additives) could produce some “fuel NOx,” but in conventional fuels this is negligible. Third, combustion phasing 
influences NOx – if a fuel burns very rapidly and early, the sharp pressure and temperature spike can increase NOx. High-cetane fuels in a diesel, for 
example, can advance combustion timing, sometimes raising NOx (hence a trade-off often observed: measures to reduce NOx like retarding timing or using 
EGR tend to increase soot or reduce efficiency). In designing new fuels, I consider low adiabatic flame temperature as a favorable trait for NOx reduction. 
Fuels with some inert components or higher specific heat (e.g. fuels containing oxygen or even certain diluents) can yield cooler flames. There is a delicate 
balance, however – too low a flame temperature can lead to incomplete combustion (raising CO/UHC). Thus, my goal is fuels that burn at reasonable 
temperatures but possibly avoid extremely high peaks. Another consideration is octane sensitivity: fuels that are sensitive (high RON – MON difference) 
tend to have more advanced ignition under high loads, which can suppress knock but sometimes create broader heat release that might lower NOx. These 
nuances show how fuel properties intertwine with NOx formation. Ultimately, regardless of fuel, modern engines also employ aftertreatment (catalytic 
converters, SCR systems) to handle NOx, but reducing engine-out NOx with smart fuel design (like leaning towards premixed low-temp combustion
