Table: Top eight candidates from the Brutal profile. These are highly elaborate molecules, often combining multiple branched motifs, cyclic substructures, 
and functional groups (notably ethers, indicated by OC patterns). They achieved the highest surrogate scores (approaching 1.0 in our normalized scale). 
Such structures are likely at the very edge of chemical plausibility and certainly not common fuel compounds, but they illustrate what the engine’s scoring 
algorithm deems nearly “perfect” after exploring ~10^6 possibilities. 
Performance Comparison and Scaling Behavior 
Having run all profiles on both systems, we can compare the performance and observe scaling trends. The table below summarizes the execution times 
measured for each profile on the two hardware setups: 
Profile         Candidates (approx)   Time on i7-8700    Time on i5-12th 
Ultra-snappy    ~30                   2 s                1.5 s  
Demo            ~200                  8 s                6 s  
Classroom       ~3,000                60 s               45 s  
Light Stress    ~50,000               300 s (5 min)      220 s (~3.7 min)  
Heavy Stress    ~180,000              1200 s (20 min)    900 s (15 min)
