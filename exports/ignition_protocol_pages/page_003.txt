Abstract 
Ignition Protocol is a genetically driven framework for discovering and validating synthetic fuels. This fragment-based algorithm, seeded with molecules 
from the GDB-17 database, generates candidates evaluated through a multi-objective fitness function balancing molecular weight, oxygen-to-carbon ratio, 
volatility, and combustion potential. This gives a smooth gateway for future laboratory work through tests such as combustion fingerprinting—using flame 
imaging and spectrometry—and biodegradability assays assessing microbial stability and environmental persistence. By combining cheminformatics, 
evolutionary optimization, and future combustion diagnostics, and microbiological testing, the project delivers a scalable approach to fuel discovery that 
links molecular structure directly to performance and sustainability.
