 
Ultra-snappy Profile 
The Ultra-snappy profile is configured for speed above all else. We typically start with 1 seed molecule and allow only 1 generation of mutations with a very 
limited branching factor (e.g., each seed can only produce a few immediate children at most). No iterative deepening is performed; it’s essentially one quick 
round of molecule generation and evaluation. This profile often serves to sanity-check that the engine pipeline is functioning end-to-end, and it provides 
near-instant results. 
Parameterization: 1 initial seed; 1 mutation iteration; very few mutations per seed (due to either an explicit cap or naturally by limited fragment options); 
full filtering and scoring applied, but on a tiny pool. 
Estimated candidate count: On the order of 10^1–10^2. We expected perhaps a few dozen candidates at most from this run. 
Actual candidates processed: ~30–40 molecules (including the initial seed and all mutants) were generated and evaluated in our Ultra-snappy test. 
Execution time: As hoped, this profile runs in mere seconds. On the i7-8700 (System A), the Ultra-snappy run completed in roughly 2 seconds, while on 
the newer i5-12th Gen system (System B) it finished in about 1.5 seconds. The difference between systems is negligible at this scale – both feel 
instantaneous – though System B’s newer CPU was ~25% faster in absolute terms. 
Even with such a tiny workload, we obtain a set of candidate molecules with associated scores. The top eight molecules from the Ultra-snappy run (ranked 
by the engine’s fuel performance score) are listed below for illustration. These molecules are generally simple structures due to the minimal expansion. We 
note that in such a constrained run, the engine isn’t likely to find highly optimized or novel candidates – the output is more a demonstration of the process. 
Ultra-snappy Top 8 Molecules (by score): 
Rank  Molecule (SMILES)           Score 
1     CC(C)CCC                   0.85  
2     CCC(C)C(C)C                0.83  
3     CC(C)COC                   0.79  
4     CCCCCC                     0.78  
5     CCC(C)OCC                  0.75  
6     CC(C)(C)CC                 0.74  
7     CCCCOC                     0.73  
8     CCCC=C(C)C                 0.70  
Table: Top eight candidates from the Ultra-snappy profile. Molecules are identified by SMILES strings; for instance, CC(C)CCC (Rank 1) is a branched alkane, 
and CCC(C)C(C)C (Rank 2) is a similar branched hydrocarbon. Scores are the composite ignition performance score (higher is better). 
Demo Profile 
The Demo profile is a step up in complexity, intended for use in live demonstrations where a bit more time (tens of seconds) is acceptable to get a richer set 
of results. Here we allow a slightly more extensive search:
