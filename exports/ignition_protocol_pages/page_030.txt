 
Functional Group​
 A specific group of atoms (e.g. –OH, –COOH, –NO₂) that determines a molecule’s chemical behaviour. The presence of oxygen-containing groups like 
esters or alcohols can influence combustion efficiency and emissions. 
Molecular Weight (MolWt)​
 The total mass of a molecule, calculated by summing the atomic weights of its atoms. Heavier molecules often have lower volatility but higher energy 
content. 
logP (Partition Coefficient)​
 A measure of how soluble a molecule is in fat versus water. High logP values suggest the molecule is hydrophobic, which affects how it blends with other 
fuels and its environmental behaviour. 
Oxygen-to-Carbon Ratio (O:C Ratio)​
 A simple metric comparing the number of oxygen atoms to carbon atoms. Fuels with higher O:C ratios often burn more cleanly and produce fewer 
particulates, but may have lower energy density. 
Ring Count​
 The number of aromatic or aliphatic rings in a molecule. This can influence fuel volatility, combustion stability and structural rigidity. 
Halogen Penalty​
 In the scoring system, molecules containing fluorine, chlorine or bromine are penalised, as halogenated compounds are typically toxic, persistent and 
environmentally hazardous. 
 
🧬 Computational Chemistry & AI Terms 
Genetic Algorithm (GA)​
 A computational search and optimisation method inspired by evolution. Candidate solutions are encoded, evaluated for “fitness”, and iteratively improved 
through simulated mutation and recombination. In this project, molecules are “bred” based on fitness scores related to fuel properties. 
Fitness Function​
 A numerical score assigned to each candidate molecule to indicate how well it meets the desired criteria (e.g. molecular weight, logP, O:C ratio). Used to 
rank molecules for selection and guide evolution. 
Tanimoto Similarity / Distance​
 A metric used to compare the structural similarity between two molecules, based on their binary fingerprints. A Tanimoto score close to 1 means two 
molecules are almost identical; close to 0 means completely different. Used to enforce structural diversity. 
Molecular Fingerprint​
 A digital representation of a molecule's structure, often as a long string of binary digits. Each digit indicates the presence or absence of specific features or 
substructures. 
RDKit​
 An open-source cheminformatics toolkit written in C++ and Python. Used for manipulating SMILES strings, calculating molecular properties and generating 
visual diagrams of molecules. 
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)​
 A technique for simplifying complex datasets by reducing their dimensions. Used in this project to visualise trends across fuel candidates or combustion 
fingerprints by compressing multiple property values into two or three principal axes.
