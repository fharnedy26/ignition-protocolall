 
Parameterization: 1 seed molecule (sometimes 2 for variety, but primarily one to keep focus); 2 generations of mutations. This means the seed produces a 
set of first-generation children, each of which then produces second-generation children. The branching factor per generation is moderate (each molecule 
might spawn a handful of new ones). All standard filters and scoring apply. 
Estimated candidate count: On the order of 10^2. With two generations from one seed, assuming for example ~5 mutations in the first generation and each 
of those yields ~5 in the second, we predicted around 5 + 5*5 = 30 new molecules, plus the seed (~31). In practice, if fragments allow more combinations, 
this can grow; we expected maybe a couple hundred at most. 
Actual candidates processed: Approximately 200–250 molecules were generated and evaluated in the Demo run. The slight increase beyond the simple 
estimate came from a few extra fragment possibilities and the engine not strictly limiting second-generation offspring from each first-gen candidate. 
Execution time: This more involved run still completes quickly. On System A (i7-8700), the Demo profile typically finished in about 8 seconds. On System 
B (i5-12th/RTX 3060 Ti), it completed in roughly 6 seconds. The newer system was about one-quarter to one-third faster, which is consistent with its higher 
per-core speed. Both times are comfortably under half a minute, making this profile practical for demo settings. 
With two mutation generations, the Demo profile yields more diverse and optimized molecules than Ultra-snappy, since the search explores a broader 
space. The top 8 scoring molecules from a Demo run are shown below. We begin to see slightly larger or more complex structures appear (for example, 
multi-branched alkanes or molecules with simple functional groups introduced, depending on fragment availability). Again, these outputs are primarily to 
verify that the engine is producing reasonable results; any particularly high-scoring molecule here reflects the limited search scope.

Table: Top eight candidates from the Demo profile run. Compared to Ultra-snappy, these include slightly more complex topologies (e.g., ring structures like 
in Rank 1’s SMILES, or longer branched chains). The scoring function favored these candidates under the quick surrogate evaluation. 
Classroom Profile 
The Classroom profile represents a mid-range workload, suitable for an interactive exercise where users can run the engine and get results within a class or 
workshop session. The configuration further scales up the search while aiming to keep runtime on the order of a few minutes:
